CpoUtil v2.5 Release Notes
--------------------------



Source Control for CPO...sorta
------------------------------
JDBC Connections now require you to specify a sql output directory.  You'll be prompted to do so upon opening a cpo browser, or when you edit a connection.  On all exports and "Save Child Changes" operations, CpoUtil will output sql files for every class (same sql that's generated when you do "Export SQL for Class") to the sql output directory.  These files allow you to save them in subversion (or other source control system) to allow a way to enable storing cpo changes in source control.  The resulting files will be named after the fully qualified class name.  

If the sql output directory is empty, CpoUtil will 'prime' the directory by creating all of the export files for you.

You'll want to set this to the same folder that everyone on the project uses.  For example, the sql output dir for a project might be set to <project>/sql/cpo so all of the files go in there.



Export All
----------
There is no more "Export all" option.  It has been combined with "Export all with deletes".  Performing an export all will now force a refresh from the database to assure that you are using the lastest data, then export all of the individual files from above.  It will also generate and maintain a file named CPO_CREATE_ALL.sql.  This file is what used to get generated by "Export All Cpo w/ Deletes", but with some unneeded parts removed.  



Guess Attributes - experimental
-------------------------------
While looking at the query text for a SQL statement of a query group you can now have CpoUtil attempt to guess at the attributes you used in your query.  The requirement for this is that your attributes MUST have column names specified (they will if you generated them from SQL as opposed to typing them in).  To use it, in the "SQL" text area where you typed your query, right click and select the "Guess Attributes (Experimental)" menu option.  CpoUtil will then attempt to parse your query and fill in the table of attributes below, so you don't have to.  Note this feature is experimental still, so make sure to examine what has been generated to assure the data is correct.
 


Code Cleanup / Bug Fixes
------------------------
-Implemented generics throughout CpoUtil for easier maintainability.  
-Cleaned up a few of the screens.  
-Changed query groups to sort again, so it's easier to find the one you're looking for. 
-Added a progress bar to the exports so that it no longer looks like CpoUtil hung and you'll have an idea that it's actually still working and not hung.
-Fixed a potential query breaker.  If you cut and paste a query into CpoUtil and it ends with a semicolon (;), CpoUtil will remove it from the end of the query for you.
